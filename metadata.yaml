description: "Things as They Are; or The Adventures of Caleb Williams (often abbreviated\
  \ to Caleb Williams) (1794) by William Godwin is a three-volume novel written as\
  \ a call to end the abuse of power by what Godwin saw as a tyrannical government.\
  \ Intended as a popularisation of the ideas presented in his 1793 treatise Political\
  \ Justice Godwin uses Caleb Williams to show how legal and other institutions can\
  \ and do destroy individuals, even when the people the justice system touches are\
  \ innocent of any crime. This reality, in Godwin's mind, was therefore a description\
  \ of \"things as they are.\" The original manuscript included a preface that was\
  \ removed from publication, because its content alarmed booksellers of the time.\n\
